# Suite Career #
Suite Career is a recruitment service that prioritizes the needs of the applicant above that of the recruiter. The platform serves as a tool to develop the recruitable skillset of an applicant over not just a short period, but a lifetime of work and recruiting engagement.

Proposed features for the platform are:
1. Applicant/Recruiter Matchmaking Algorithm
2. Applicant Portfolio
3. Recruiting Toolbox
4. Recruiter Profiles
